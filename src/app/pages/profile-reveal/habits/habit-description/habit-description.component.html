A Stanford study showed that monotaskers are less easily distracted, more productive, and less error-prone than multitaskers, in general. For creative thinking, monotasking can help the in-depth thinking that allows remote associates and other good ideas to be found. It may be an especially helpful trait in the execution phase of a project. Monotasking, however, doesn’t beat out multitasking in all areas; in fact, monotasking is often closely associated with highly creative people, and may be more advantageous than monotasking in the early phases of a project when divergent thinking is helpful In the execution phase.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Specialists have the benefit of developing deep expertise in one creative area that allows them to innovate in ways that a generalist might not. Additionally, specialists that achieve true expertise have such deep knowledge bases that they are able to process information very quickly (called, "automatization") and they develop a sense of the nuances within the area of expertise. Holmes (1990) suggested that this gave experts meaningful "hunches" or intuitions. The potential creative cost of specialization is that this style may have fewer opportunities to discover novel ideas through cross-fertilization from other disciplines and alternative perspectives. Specialists might consider occasionally exploring other areas to avoid getting in a creative rut.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">A generalist has a wide range of creative interests and styles, and research shows creativity - especially the ability to generate novel ideas - to benefit from wide interests. Howard Gruber described the benefits of the “networks of enterprise,” where the multitasking generalist maintains different projects at different stages of fruition. Generalising is associated with highly-creative people, like Picasso, for instance, who was adept at creating art in multiple media and styles. The potential creative cost of generalization is that the style may miss the opportunities to innovate that come from diving in deeper. Generalists might consider experimenting with focusing on one subject or project longer than is typically comfortable.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Solo creators are often romanticized as “lone geniuses” who shun the distraction of groups. Indeed, studies have concluded that working alone often leads to better results. This is fine for someone whose creative efforts don’t require others, but there is a lot of emphasis on creative collaboration in our society, and teamwork is often a requirement in the workplace. So what is a solo creator to do? When possible, the independent creative thinker can contribute to a collaborative project by carving out time and space to work independently on discrete parts of a group project.</p>

Collaboration is often promoted as a desired creative style, especially in the workplace, but the research shows that it doesn’t necessarily lead to better results than working alone. To give their team the best chance of success, highly-collaborative creators might consider how best to nurture the talent of solo creators in the group who need the space to work on their own. Additionally, alternating working in groups and working alone may help provide a team the benefits of both creative styles.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Some of the most successful creators are driven by self-criticism, seeing flaws that others don’t and pushing themselves to be extremely high performers. Although self-criticism can be harnessed in the pursuit of greater creativity, it can easily be a destructive force in one’s life, stifling creative thought, or much worse. Self-critics could benefit from being mindful of the difference between being constructive and self-bullying. In his Encyclopedia of Creativity, Gary Davis describes what he calls “squelchers.” As the name implies, these are things people tell themselves that shut the door on creative thinking. Examples of squelching statements include, “this will never work,” “it will never fly,” “don’t rock the boat,” “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">A self-assured creative thinker has the confidence to follow through on an idea, not allowing small flaws to derail potential success. There are innumerable well-known creative thinkers who never doubted the power of their ideas. In a Stanford University commencement speech, Steve Jobs explained that his confidence was rooted in having faith in his ideas. saying, “…believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path...” Although being self-assured is certainly more psychologically comfortable, if manifest as overconfidence, it may make it more difficult to spot potential flaws in ideas, and cause the creative thinker to move forward too quickly on a project. A little healthy self-criticism can help avoid potential issues further on.</p>

However, distractions aren’t always bad for creative thinking; they can allow people to incubate on the key problem in the background while allowing their mind to be diverted by other subjects. According to Maurice James D’Arcy Colins, distraction may help "disinhibition," and, "the disinhibition hypothesis suggests creative cognition can be assisted by reducing cognitive inhibition of ideas, facilitating looser associative thoughts to bond with one another to produce novel concepts." People who love distractions may excel in divergent thinking aspects of the creative process but may suffer in the execution phase; while the reverse may be true for people who hate distractions.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">The modern world can be a cruel place for creative thinkers who hate distractions; those rare stretches of focus can be broken so easily by a chirp from a phone or knock on the office door. In order to escape distractions, the Minimalist painter Agnes Martin took the extreme step of moving to a remote desert home, where she had no television, radio, or telephone — and not even a pet for fear it could be a distraction. For those who can’t always avoid distractions, however, there is evidence to support the idea that distractions are good for creative thinking, allowing one’s mind to continue working on a task while their attention is diverted elsewhere.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Outwardly-inspired people seek sources of motivation from the world around them. What exactly “inspiration” is, however, isn’t easy to answer. Everyone seems to recognize it when they experience it, and inspiration’s link to creativity is undeniable. Outwardly-inspired people can cultivate their inspiration by seeking out what the world has to offer: reading, traveling, and collaborating with others. As B. F. Skinner said, “if you find something that is interesting, drop everything else and study it.”</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Rational creative thinking occupies one side of a spectrum with intuitiveness at the other.  These people can see the shape and nuance of a creative problem, and go to work solving it. While a rational and organized approach to creative thinking has clear merits, since much of the creative process benefits from random associations there is good experimental research showing that intuition is also valuable. (Bower, 199; Martindale, 1983)  Creative thinkers who work with more intuitive team members might consider exploring some off-shoot ideas that don’t immediately follow the plan. They may just find there are unforeseen benefits to incorporating both styles.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">An intuitive approach to creative can work well because there is often a benefit to incubation, where the problem or task is put aside so that intuitive processes are allowed to go to work. There is good experimental research showing that intuition works: it helps, at least on certain kinds of problems (Bower, 199; Martindale, 1983). The potential upsides of intuitive thinking might also explain the success of the “Let it happen” approach also addressed in this survey. Furthermore, those who reach a level of mastery over a subject or process can draw on a depth of acquired knowledge so that their intuition contains within it a consistent rationale.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Externally-motivated creative thinkers are driven by the expectations of the world around them, or by personal needs, like salary, grades, respect, etc. In this situation, it can be harder to feel the freedom and be willing to take the risks associated with originality. This doesn’t mean that many successful creative thinkers have not been successful. For example, the author Agatha Christie would only write novels when she wanted to buy a new house or pay for an expensive vacation. Although it would be nice if everyone could always be internally motivated, that’s simply not the reality. So externally-motivated people don’t need to lose sleep over whether or not their motivations are pure enough and can simply focus on the creative process itself.</p>

Beethoven was famous for taking “long, vigorous walks” in which he carried a pencil and blank sheet music. However, movement seems to be more beneficial in certain parts of the creative process than others: A Stanford study showed that while walking may help people with divergent thinking, focused thinking to find one correct answer (also known as convergent thinking) didn't improve during or after a brief walk. In fact, subjects performed slightly worse. Exercise can also indirectly benefit creativity simply by being a healthful activity, helping a person think more clearly and have the stamina and focus to undertake creative projects.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">While many popular articles about the creative habits of successful people tout the benefits of walking or exercise, it doesn’t mean people who don’t take long walks will never be creative. There may be other ways to free the mind for fluid, flexible, divergent thinking. There are many highly creative and successful people who are non-kinetic creative people. Einstein, for example, used other approaches to take breaks and free the mind - like music breaks or play.  Similarly, non-kinetic practices like mindfulness meditation may be equally effective at facilitating divergent thought. Non-kinetic creative thinkers might keep in mind that although there are many ways to affect creativity directly, movement and exercise can indirectly benefit creativity simply through being part of a healthy lifestyle.</p>

In fact, slower-paced creative thinkers may be more likely to benefit from “remote associates,” where thinking goes to novel and original spaces because there is more time for incubation, and where the mind is relatively free from self-censorship and the squelchers mentioned above (Davis, 1999). It is possible that a person can increase the pace of idea generation through practice, technique use, and experience, but what’s important here is that slower-paced creative thinkers can embrace their pace and use the time between new ideas to focus on developing the quality and depth of each.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Many ideas are too, well, ideal to be practical. Limitations abound on almost any creative project: budget, time, external pressures, and production limitations will force the creative thinker to make compromises. This is especially common among creative professionals who must come up with solutions for clients. While, those who never have to compromise can consider themselves quite lucky, the reality is that the best creative result typically lies somewhere on a spectrum between pushing for perfection while being flexible enough to make pragmatic concessions.</p>

And those who do pursue perfection, straddle an unenviable divide between doing truly great work, and the negative emotions associated with feeling the work is never truly great. Those who experience this anxiety might condider taking into account that unchecked perfectionism can inhibit creative thought, and take a break, or work on another project when negative emotions build up.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">There are lots of potential risks associated with creative thinking: reputational risk, financial risk, risk of wasting time on pursuing a dead-end idea. And truly novel ideas can certainly seem risky on account of the fact that they’ve never been attempted! Risk-averse creative thinkers prefer to give an idea every chance of success before devoting lots of energy to it. This approach can still succeed in high-risk creative endeavors because, by being keenly aware of the inherent risks involved, risk-averse thinkers can excel at minimizing the chances of failure by addressing all the risks in their control. Furthermore, those who feel risk-averse might consider that some risks are simply imaginary and will not result in any real harm. Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx, had the idea for footless pantyhose. She kept her day job for two years while launching her company. She became America’s youngest self-made billionaire with a truly novel idea, but played it safe by making sure she had the financial resources to make it work.</p>

Risk-friendly creative thinkers may have the disadvantage of not bothering to mitigate controllable risks, but at the same time will have the advantage of not being so easily stymied by risks that are not possible to control.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">“Let it happen” tactics are where a person takes a walk or directs their thinking to things other than the creative task. They trust their intuition and incubation to keep working on the creative task even if their conscious mind is elsewhere. Let it happen also involves looking for outside inspiration (e.g., talking to others, looking to nature for inspiration). One advantage of the “let it happen” style is that it allows people to easily capitalize on chance opportunities that may have not been part of the original plan. It doesn’t mean that a person doesn’t have a clear vision for what they want to create, but rather that they have more fluidity in how that vision is accomplished. Keep in mind, a ‘let it happen’ approach can be difficult for others in a group who prefer a clear plan where every step in the process is well articulated.</p>

This tenacity might allow a person to stick with a new or controversial idea, even in the face of criticism. For instance, Thomas Edison’s light bulb was once called a “conspicuous failure.” Truly creative ideas are often novel, and therefore risk being misunderstood. A tenacious individual might continue to refine an idea and explain it until its value is finally socially recognized.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Reframers are willing to step back and change perspective on creative problems that aren’t yielding results, and are comfortable dropping unpromising ideas completely. Einstein was a reframer, famously reconsidering a difficult problem as, “what would it look like if … I was riding a beam of light?” There is good evidence that shows reframing is linked to creativity, some of which comes from the research on “problem definition” (Adams, 2003; Root-Bernstein, 1988). Reframers, however, can take a lesson from tenacious creative thinkers, since sometimes the best ideas can only be found after pushing past perceived roadblocks.</p>

In fact, Studies have confirmed that creativity can be stimulated by public spaces, something researchers nicknamed the “Starbucks Effect.” A possible reason for this is that noise is a type of beneficial distraction: if attention is focused on one line of thought, creative ideas are unlikely. People who like working and thinking in public spaces are certainly in good company.

          <p class="cover-half__text">Many people find it difficult to concentrate and think creatively in a public, noisy environment. Studies have been conducted among school-aged children that show noise can negatively affect selective attention and recall. Interestingly, similar studies show that moderate amounts of noise like that found in coffee shops or cafés can actually help creative thinking because they distract the mind from locking in on only one line of thought. So those who prefer private spaces may find their creative thinking benefits by occasionally taking their ideation to a public area.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Common wisdom holds that a silence offers fewer distractions to the mind, thus allowing for greater levels of concentration and deeper thought. This may well be true for many people, but there are studies that have shown creativity can be stimulated by moderate levels of noise. Nicknamed the “Starbucks Effect,” people who are exposed to noise of the level and type found in coffee shops (70 dB, with varying traffic and speech sounds overlapped), give more original answers compared to participants working in low noise (50 dB) and high noise (85 dB) conditions. Ultimately, whether silence or noise works for a person may come depend on personal preference.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Noise is an environmental factor that may affect creativity, but the reason for this is not fully understood. Studies have shown that creativity can be stimulated by moderate levels of noise. Nicknamed the “Starbucks Effect,” people who are exposed to noise of the level and type found in coffee shops give more original answers compared to participants working in low noise and high noise conditions. One reason for this may be that some level of distraction actually distracts the mind from locking in on a single line of thought. However, another study showed that young children showed lower levels of creativity while exposed to similar noise levels, although the creativity did increase with age. Ultimately, whether or not moderate noise works for a person may come down to personal preference.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Many creative thinkers prefer to vary their surroundings in the hope of stimulating thought and generating new ideas. David Shenk, a successful author, uses several desks that are a mix of sitting or standing so he can change his setting when he gets antsy. Like nature lovers, novelty-seekers may also benefit from exposing themselves to ideas and solutions found in the world around them. A study by Marleen Gillebaart showed that novelty-seeking may benefit creative performance when divergent thinking is required, but it could also inhibit creative performance when convergent thinking is required.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Different styles and habits can be used by different people to the benefit of creative outcomes. Routines are sometimes used by creative people so they can get through the day expending little effort on things that are unrelated to their creative efforts. Having routines for one’s uncreative tasks may free up time for the important things–creative work. For instance, Rodney Mullen, the godfather of modern street skating, expressed that his creativity relies on a fixed routine that every night: he practices at precisely the same time every night while listening to the “exact same” music playlist. Routines may also be important for successful execution of creative ideas - for example many writers or artists stick to a strict schedule at their desk or in their studio to ensure that every day a little more gets done.</p>

Constraints can achieve this by forcing the mind to work harder to find the right idea.

          <p class="cover-half__text">Some people thrive with all eyes on them - the pressure, excitement, and others’ attention amping up their performers on-the-feet thinking. This is typically the territory of extrinsically-motivated, fast-paced, and self-assured creative thinkers, and a style one might find in good group-brainstormers, improv comedians, and musical soloists. Given the value society places on performative ability, those who are comfortable in these kinds of situations probably also see benefits in their professional lives as well. The character Don Draper in the TV show Mad Men comes to mind, for instance. Society may glorify this kind of ability, but that shouldn’t discount the equal creative abilities of non-performers. Furthermore, performers’ desire to please an audience may inhibit the novelty of their ideas since they devote energy toward impression management and social recognition.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Non-performers are no less creative than performers, but they do not feel motivated or inspired by the same external factors that ignite performers. Non-performers are typically internally-motivated, and don’t put energy into pleasing others. Although society places praise and attention on performers, non-performers are more likely to consider the unconventional or unpopular ideas that can lead to novel concepts.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">For many people, highly creative output may come in intense bursts of activity followed by periods of creative quiet. During the ‘creative doldrums’, the creator can feel like their sails will never fill with creative winds again. There is good news for those who feel stuck in a rut because it’s possible that downtime may encourage “remote associates,” where thinking goes to novel and original spaces because there is more time for incubation, and where the mind is relatively free from self-censorship and the “squelcher” statements like “this will never work.” (Davis, 1999). Those who feel inconsistent can help take pressure off to allow themselves to focus on other work, or take a break, while remaining poised to capitalize on the next creative storm when it naturally arrives again. </p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Those who find the creation process pleasant should count themselves fortunate, because many people become stressed by creative projects. Happiness and contentment while working on a creative task is typically associated with “broad attention,” and wide or even loose associations. Such associations in the thinking process allow a person to go beyond conventional ideas and find original possibilities. (Isen, 2000) has demonstrated the cognitive benefits of happiness in various experimental studies. (Kaufmann 2000) qualified Isen’s findings and demonstrated that the benefit varies from task to task.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">The “tortured artist” is a bit of a cultural legend: the melancholy creator slaving away to make something to benefit the world, but sacrificing their happiness in the process. This story may be a stereotype, but it’s not a myth. And certainly many people experience anxiety, doubt, impatience, and any number of other negative emotions while creating. For many, the stress of creation is only balanced by the catharsis of a project's completion. Ultimately, however, one's mental and emotional health is more important than any creative task.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Brainstorming is an integral practice in many companies, but they can feel like a waste of time to those who don’t feel comfortable or creative in these group sessions. In fact, the data show that, contrary to popular wisdom, most people are actually less original when brainstorming than when working alone. One review paper (Rickards, 2003) looked at about 1000 studies of brainstorming and concluded that it is not good for originality as working alone. This is not likely to change corporate work habits, so those who are partial to group ideation, might suggest mixing up group sessions with solo work as well.</p>

          <p class="cover-half__text">Brainstorming sessions with whiteboards, markers, and sticky notes are an iconic image of many corporate innovation workshops. However, most of the data show that people are actually less original when brainstorming than when working alone. While brainstorming is useful at certain times in the creative process, the most original ideas are far more likely to be found when working alone. Group ideators who want to make the most of the creative process should consider making time for solo ideation as well.</p>

            <p class="cover-half__text">Creativity researchers often break down the creative process into different phases: Problem definition, Ideation, Evaluation, and Implementation. Different people may gravitate toward different aspects of the creative process, some preferring to clarify the problem being solved, others generating many possible novel solutions, while others defining the problem and possible solutions so they can focus their creative energy on execution. Being aware of where one’s tendencies lie can be very important for assembling successful collaborative groups that include people who have strengths in different parts of the process.</p>
