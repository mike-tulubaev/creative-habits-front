          You will receive at the end a unique anonymous ID which will only be
          used to allow you to return to the site and see your results. Only you
          will be able to connect that id to you. We will install a few cookies
          on your computer for the sole purpose of making the site function
          better for you â€” for example so we don't show you the introductory
          video after the first time you arrive on on the site. We do not use
          those cookies to track your online behavior. Did we mention that we
          don't track you?
